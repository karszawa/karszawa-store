# karszawa-store

You can buy karszawa goods here.

## Implementation Plan

- [ ] item list page
- [ ] item detail page
- [ ] checkout page

Use Firestore as database?

## Tech Stack

- React (Mainly in hooks)
- Next
- TypeScript
- styled-components
- Material-UI
- Redux
- Advanced
  - Portals for transition from item detail to checkout page
  - amp-stories for item list
  - Web Payment API for filling the form
  - comlink (for what?)
  - perception-toolkit (for what?)

## Things what I was struggled by

- amp types - there are no type definitions in amp-stories
